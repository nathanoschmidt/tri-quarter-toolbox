## 1. Overview

The **Tri-Quarter Toolbox** is a public open-source software repository containing scientific research tools, implementations, and experiments regarding Nathan O. Schmidt's **Tri-Quarter Framework (TQF)**—a mathematical and computational framework that upgrades the complex numbers for working with unified 2D coordinates, inversive geometry, Eisenstein integers, **radial dual triangular lattice graph (RDTLG)**, hexagonal symmetries, signal processing, equivariant encodings, and geometric deep learning.

The TQF is based on prior (2007-2017) and current (2025-present) academic research in advanced computer science and mathematics. This TQF toolbox is developed by Cold Hammer Research & Development LLC as an after-hours hobby science project driven by rigorous creativity, a first principles mindset, scientific methodology, and a passion for exploring the intersection of computational/mathematical fields such as data structures, algorithms, parallel computing, graph theory, discrete mathematics, group theory, cryptography, machine learning, and more.

The repository is organized into subdirectories containing various projects and tools, each with their own documentation. All code aims to be cross-platform compatible (Windows/Linux/macOS) with solid practices. 

**Core Philosophy:**
- 🏀 **Richard Feynman's Quote**: "*Science is the belief in the ignorance of experts*"
- ⛓️‍💥 **Freedom and Technical Problem Solving**: Ask questions, challenge groupthink/censorship, and seek answers via the Scientific Method
- 🧬 **First Principles Design**: Mathematical rigor meets practical implementation
- 🔄 **Symmetry-Aware Computing**: Exploit geometric structure for efficient elegant solutions
- 📊 **Reproducibility**: Fixed seeds, documented environments, and transparent methods
- 🔬 **Open Science**: MIT-licensed code and public research artifacts
- 💡 **Continuous Learning**: Experimental projects exploring new ideas
- 🧪 **Automated Testing**: Each time code is deployed to production without automated testing, a child gets a mullet (and yes, some of these tools have contributed to mullets—it's work in progress 🤣)

Dev and scientist for life. 💾🗲🚀

## 5. The Tri-Quarter Framework

### Summary

The TQF is a mathematical and computational framework that unifies complex, Cartesian, and polar coordinate systems on the complex plane ℂ. It centers on truncated radial dual triangular lattice graphs (RDTLGs) constructed over Eisenstein integers (ℤ[ω]), while establishing fundamental topological and reflective properties across circles of arbitrary radius.

The foundational contribution, as presented in the unifying preprint, is the **Tri-Quarter Topological Duality Theorem**, which equips any circle T_r (of radius r > 0) with a novel topological property. This theorem positions T_r as an active boundary zone with intrinsic directional characteristics, enabling consistent separation of the inner zone X_{−,r} (|z| < r) and outer zone X_{+,,r} (|z| > r) through a phase pair map that encodes additional directional information and unifies the treatment of real and imaginary components across coordinate systems.

Complementing this is the **Escher Tri-Quarter Reflective Duality Theorem**, which proves reflective duality across T_r via circle inversion. This map preserves phase pairs while bijectively swapping the inner and outer zones, providing an exact topological and reflective correspondence.

Building on these duality principles, TQF provides:

- **Exact bijective duality** between inner and outer zones via circle inversion
- **Native support for three symmetry groups**:
  - **ℤ₆** — rotational symmetry (order 6, 60° increments)
  - **D₆** — dihedral symmetry (order 12, rotations + reflections)
  - **𝕋₂₄** — inversive hexagonal dihedral symmetry (order 24, D₆ extended by circle inversion)
- **Phase-pair directional encoding** aligned with 60° angular sectors, serving as the unifying mechanism for radial separation and orientation
- **Path mirroring** and symmetry-aware algorithms exploiting geometric structure

TQF enables novel approaches in:
- Geometric deep learning and equivariant neural architectures
- Signal processing (e.g., BPSK demodulation with hexagonal symmetry)
- Graph algorithms on dual-zone lattices
- Visual and algebraic understanding of complex-plane geometry, including streamlined directional mappings and computational efficiency gains (e.g., reduced conditional checks in quadrant-based transformations)

These properties originate from the topological and reflective dualities proven across circles of any radius, forming the theoretical foundation upon which subsequent TQF extensions—such as lattice graph implementations and symmetry-aware neural networks—are constructed.
